## Going with the trend: Chat GPT and my new chat bot ðŸ¤–

 I've been working with chat GPT (Generative Pre-training Transformer) very closely over the past few days, and I have to say, I find it really interesting. In fact, last week around 40% of my code was generated by chat GPT.

I decided to go with the trend and create a chat bot powered by chat GPT. I'm excited to share the project with you - check out the GitHub repository at the link below. Just a heads up, the codebase is minimal (as it was generated by chat GPT ðŸ˜‰).

It's important to remember that while AI can be a huge time-saver, we should not rely on it completely. Use AI as a tool to assist you, but always double-check and use your own critical thinking skills.

If you're interested in learning more about how to build a project like this using Flutter, here are a few resources that might be helpful:

-   [GPT-3 API documentation](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/gpt-3)
-   [OpenAI API client library for Dart](https://pub.dev/packages/openai)
-   [Flutter documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs)

I hope you enjoy the project as much as I enjoyed building it. Let me know what you think in the comments!
